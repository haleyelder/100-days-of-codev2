### March 31
- **today i..** continued with the Front End Libraries cert, I worked out the rest of the tests to pass in the Markdown previewer as well as fixed up some odd input bug. all tests pass! expecting to work on some styling tomorrow
  - **thoughts:** those tests were quite annoying since you would think you would get them right but slightly off, reading some others code to see what they did, I read through and tailored my own functionality
