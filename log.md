**start date:** March 31, 2019; **prospective end date:** July 9, 2019

### 4: April 9
- **today i..** need to regrab those audio clips! a update ran, i guess, and the notepad i had them in disappeared (save your work, friends!). started setting up an object to reference with the necessary info for the on handle key press function rather than a big ol messy looking switch case. 
  - **thoughts:** slow brain day I'd call it, lot of todos prior to getting to coding, knew i'd have to do a leeeetle bit to keep going, too much googling how to recall nested objects. double thinkin in the tests for this project says the buttons have to be clickable and keypress, does it need play, pause, stop? eh?

### 3: April 7
- **today i..** grabbed the audio clips from the example project, not to look at the solution too closely and set up a handleKeyPress event function that works! with 2 keys so far. by looking at the tests, had to decide if a few child components could be done (is better) or looping through an object. probably start with object refactoring first
  - **thoughts:** surprised it was pretty quick to get the keypress sound going! most slowdown was due to unfocused, bored brain and impatient with Codepen's DDOS attack. no big complaint there, just made the refresh load slowly

### 2: April 1 (no foolin')
- **today i..** forgo the aforementioned styling, will circle back when pushing to my live site. continue scoping out the next project for a keyboard based Drum kit, have a good skeleton started. keypress logs to the console, found some audio clips, next to connect those functions!
  - **thoughts:** spent way too long looking for the audio file reference to use in browser, the example codepen will suffice, kinda want to use an API but... later

### 1: March 31
- **today i..** continued with the Front End Libraries cert, I worked out the rest of the tests to pass in the Markdown previewer as well as fixed up some odd input bug. all tests pass! expecting to work on some styling tomorrow
  - **thoughts:** those tests were quite annoying since you would think you would get them right but slightly off, reading some others code to see what they did, I read through and tailored my own functionality
