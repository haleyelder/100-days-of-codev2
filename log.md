**start date:** March 31, 2019; **prospective end date:** July 9, 2019


### 29: June 12
- **today i..** continued work on a gatsby blog, the blog subdomain was already created but wouldn't resolve due to no SSL. got a free year of it through my hosting and already is resolving properly! :D now is to mold it to a theme that fits me or something like that
  - **thoughts:** reading some docs i was unsure and unaware how the posts are made since you can connect graphql to make the posts?? but renders in markdown (that part is easier), or maybe ill manually make the posts?? never used a static site generator before so this will all be new
  - time: 40min
  - tags:  DNS configurations, gatsby, etc

### 28: June 11
- **today i..** set up a local copy of my future blog powered by gatsby! long time coming i think, already pushed to live with netlify but no fancy designs out there yet :)
  - **thoughts:** saw a tutorial to move medium posts over to gatsby without having to download old posts but not sure where that went now! probably just pick and choose the ones i want to keep :P
  - time: 40min
  - tags:  DNS configurations, gatsby, etc

### 27: June 9 
- **today i..** short set up with some additional installation troubleshooting and express stuff. double the command lines! double the...work? 
  - **thoughts:** hoping my next full stack project isn't this uh, difficult, more work from the ground up more then midway on someone elses project but good tips for how to get set up!

### 26: June 8 ðŸŽ‚
- **today i..** rewatched through last 2 vids to find my mistake for the last bit of backend, no code missing, just running a configure script (nice). now onto connecting with a react frontend! also first time using parcel as a bundler
  - **thoughts:** relieved this one time it wasn't a tiny code sample that messed up! seeing those occur more and more.. better typos then more difficult fixes
  - time: 1hr
  - tags:  react
  
### 25: June 6
- **today i..** last two parts of the backend database section! slowly understanding some but i may just be forcing the knowledge of SQL and set up...felt like listening to another language (har har technically is)
  - **thoughts:** trying out this project based business and hope the next part can cement it all together, again would prefer maybe to use a diff database set up :P this one seemed overly complicated or maybe just the nature of the beast/instructor
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: vanilla js, sql

### 24: June 4
- **today i..** verifying functionality in the course and even answered some q+a some people were having issues with set up that i already passed! feelsgoodman.gif
  - **thoughts:** hit one of those fun "i am doomed why is this borked xyz" for a dash instead of =, yay programming!
  - time: 1hr
  - tags: vanilla js, sql

### 23: June 3
- **today i..** woke super early finally and feeling like i got a bit more time in my day for stuff!* as in coding* slowly getting to the end of psql stuff, well sql in general, it's confusing, mongo next?
  - **thoughts:** really not much today! zzzz
  - time: 40min
  - tags: vanilla js, sql

### 22: June 2
- **today i..** found the aforementioned stuck spot in the last logged day! had to rewatch some vids but found it was the most recent part, oh well. sort of getting the hang of SQL set up and how it connects through files, have had a small amount of flask and database integration work, re: MINIMAL, but it's kinda clicking now :P
  - **thoughts:** realizing about 30 days to 'end date' and wonder how after 2 mini hiatus I will be doing in the fture as well as hours stacked over days how that will turn out. nice to see where i was at some point i guess!
  - time: 1.5 hrs
  - tags: vanilla js, sql

### 21: May 31
- **today i..** more vids etc, thought i would have to troubleshoot the last section but now works just fine (?) huh, now to fix another thing in my next session tomorrow ish
  - **thoughts:** welp another mini hiatus
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: vanilla js

### 20: May 18
- **today i..** catching up on next steps with course, node psql is a thing?? confusing to run through the last bit but glad my config script now works
  - **thoughts:** 
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: vanilla js, sql

### 19: May 17
- **today i..** loooots of troubleshooting why the bash script still wasn't recognizing the configure script to perform a drop and create databases and then set up 2 sql pages. FINALLY got it after realizing my PATH was incorrect and cleaned that up a bit (yea, yea, should have done that earlier). weird relation to other hobby, knitting, where checking your size gauge FIRST and verifying before you start is very important!
  - **thoughts:** lot of frustration with what seemed like a simple update, but hey, got it figured out! 
  - time: 2 hrs
  - tags: psql, bash
  
### 18: May 15
- **today i..** still stuck seeing why my dropdb bash isn't firing the command, recognizes it but 'command not found' hmm...
  - **thoughts:** troubleshooting! argh!
  - time: 30min
  - tags: psql, bash

### 17: May 14
- **today i..** able to set up and verify the psql commands and what not! the first steps, and also configuring a bash script or something like that, stuck on something there...next time!
  - **thoughts:** have had such a pain trying to get psql set up last year, earlier this year, and now boom, got it it seems. more to learn!
  - time: 1 hr
  - tags: psql, bash

### 16: May 13
- **today i..** verifying some postgresql set up, the pgadmin worked fine but the command line way may be a bit off...the default user is 'haley' but i want to use 'postgres' but may not be the same user as in pgadmin?? we'll see what errors out in the next video if so 
  - **thoughts:** see above!
  - time: 1 hr
  - tags: vanilla js
  
### 15: May 12
- **today i..** bit more model building and express.js set up
  - **thoughts:** 
  - time: 30min
  - tags: vanilla js

### 14: May 9
- **today i..** more udemy course vids, got through the first section, mostly setting up models for the app, installing nodemon, etc
  - **thoughts:** so much info to cram *.* bootcamp practice maybe? 
  - time: 1 hr
  - tags: vanilla js
  
### 13: May 8
- **today i..** got an intro to Typescript through Women Who Code Portland's study group (which I lead!) but was taught by Keeley, very informative
  - **thoughts:** will need a mini project to either convert vanilla js to typescript or start off a react project with it, that's possible right...
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: typescript

### 12: May 7
- **today i..** continued video workthrough and setup
  - **thoughts:** probably need to revisit constructors and all about them soon, was distracted while working but short duration today
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: vanilla js
  
### 11: May 6
- **today i..** personal install party for a udemy course I bought over the weekend for fullstack node/react/redux project to work through. figured would get a practice run through and begin my own or something like that. 
  - **thoughts:** back to install/uninstall/reinstall postgres fun similar to my battles over the winter, idk why it was so hard! seems to be working now though
  - time: 1 hr
  - tags: vanilla js

~ a little hiatus ~

### 10: April 21
- **today i..** mostly reading today of react/redux, etc
  - **thoughts:** not much to remark on tonight! Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: react/redux
  
### 9: April 19 
- **today i..** some more redux challenges to walk through
  - **thoughts:** friday evening coding after a slow week might not have been a great idea, but i did it! ðŸ˜´
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: redux

### 8: April 18 
- **today i..** before jumping into the calculator, rehashing some redux challenges in fCC
  - **thoughts:** had a moment of 'lack of focus' and searched for something else that could quicker/easier/more simple way of teaching full stack web, but realized i needed to rehash the basics again. my memory and recall has been a bit crap lately...
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: redux

### 7: April 14
- **today i..** read over JS calculator testing suite, what was needed and structuring the calculators components, no functionality yet
  - **thoughts:** not much to report yet!
- current project: [HERE](https://codepen.io/haleyelder/full/mgBmja)
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: react

### 6: April 13
- **today i..** finished up what i could for the drumkit and submitted! i know not all tests are passing but this is the 'just make it work' stage
  - **thoughts:** kinda meh on the not all tests passing but seeing how some others did it, I'll need to refactor anyway. could pull in more props and state functionality rather than a couple of switch cases. now realized that took less than a week! calling it a win and onto the next thing!
- submitted project: [HERE](https://codepen.io/haleyelder/full/EMyveL)
  - time: 2.5 hours
  - tags: react

### 5: April 11
- **today i..** completed setting up the menial task of the object of keypress to audio elements, it didnt actually take that long. now working on a nested for in loop since chaining a lot of if statements to check for information seemed quite redundant 
  - **thoughts:** when you think something will take longer then it should and it doesn't! also glad to recall and apply multidimensional for loop for arrays can help for objects. i remember doing my first projects for fCC and could have gone this way but did the repetive i believe
- current progress: [HERE](https://codepen.io/haleyelder/full/EMyveL)
  - time: 45 min
  - tags: react

### 4: April 9
- **today i..** need to regrab those audio clips! a update ran, i guess, and the notepad i had them in disappeared (save your work, friends!). started setting up an object to reference with the necessary info for the on handle key press function rather than a big ol messy looking switch case. 
  - **thoughts:** slow brain day I'd call it, lot of todos prior to getting to coding, knew i'd have to do a leeeetle bit to keep going, too much googling how to recall nested objects. double thinkin in the tests for this project says the buttons have to be clickable and keypress, does it need play, pause, stop? eh?
- current progress: [HERE](https://codepen.io/haleyelder/full/EMyveL)
  - time: 30 min
  - tags: react

### 3: April 7
- **today i..** grabbed the audio clips from the example project, not to look at the solution too closely and set up a handleKeyPress event function that works! with 2 keys so far. by looking at the tests, had to decide if a few child components could be done (is better) or looping through an object. probably start with object refactoring first
  - **thoughts:** surprised it was pretty quick to get the keypress sound going! most slowdown was due to unfocused, bored brain and impatient with Codepen's DDOS attack. no big complaint there, just made the refresh load slowly
- current progress: [HERE](https://codepen.io/haleyelder/full/EMyveL)
  - time: 2 ish hours
  - tags: react

### 2: April 1 (no foolin')
- **today i..** forgo the aforementioned styling, will circle back when pushing to my live site. continue scoping out the next project for a keyboard based Drum kit, have a good skeleton started. keypress logs to the console, found some audio clips, next to connect those functions!
  - **thoughts:** spent way too long looking for the audio file reference to use in browser, the example codepen will suffice, kinda want to use an API but... later
- progress [HERE](https://codepen.io/haleyelder/full/EMyveL)
  - time: 1 ish hours
  - tags: react


### 1: March 31
- **today i..** continued with the Front End Libraries cert, I worked out the rest of the tests to pass in the Markdown previewer as well as fixed up some odd input bug. all tests pass! expecting to work on some styling tomorrow
  - **thoughts:** those tests were quite annoying since you would think you would get them right but slightly off, reading some others code to see what they did, I read through and tailored my own functionality
- progress **[HERE](https://codepen.io/haleyelder/full/wOGxZV)**
  - time: 3.5 ish hours
