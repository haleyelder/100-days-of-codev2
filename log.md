**start date:** March 31, 2019; **prospective end date:** July 9, 2019

### April 1 (no foolin')
- **today i..** forgo the aforementioned styling, will circle back when pushing to my live site. continue scoping out the next project for a keyboard based Drum kit, have a good skeleton started. keypress logs to the console, found some audio clips, next to connect those functions!
  - **thoughts:** spent way too long looking for the audio file reference to use in browser, the example codepen will suffice, kinda want to use an API but... later

### March 31
- **today i..** continued with the Front End Libraries cert, I worked out the rest of the tests to pass in the Markdown previewer as well as fixed up some odd input bug. all tests pass! expecting to work on some styling tomorrow
  - **thoughts:** those tests were quite annoying since you would think you would get them right but slightly off, reading some others code to see what they did, I read through and tailored my own functionality
